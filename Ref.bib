abstract = {Nowadays, universities offer most of their services using corporate website. In higher education services including admission services, a university needs to always provide excellent service to ensure student candidate satisfaction. To obtain student candidate satisfaction apart from the quality of education must also be accompanied by providing consultation services and information to them. This paper proposes the development of Chatbot which acts as a conversation agent that can play a role of as student candidate service. This Chatbot is called Dinus Intelligent Assistance (DINA). DINA uses knowledge based as a center for machine learning approach. The pattern extracted from the knowledge based can be used to provide responses to the user. The source of knowledge based is taken from Universitas Dian Nuswantoro (UDINUS) guest book. It contains of questions and answers about UDINUS admission services. Testing of this system is done by entering questions. From 166 intents, the author tested it using ten random sample questions. Among them, it got eight tested questions answered correctly. Therefore, by using this study we can develop further intelligent Chatbots to help student candidates find the information they need without waiting for the admission staffs's answer.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that may hinder or facilitate the acceptance and usage of chatbots by university students in higher education institutions (HEIs). For this study, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) is adopted for this educational context. A quantitative survey-based approach was used to collect data from 431 undergraduate and computer science masters students at Brunel University London. The data were analysed using partial least squares - structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS3. The findings showed that three primary constructs, namely, performance expectancy, effort expectancy and habit significantly predicted students' behavioural intention (BI) to use chatbot technology. Our results can guide policymakers in their attempts to explain and encourage the adoption and acceptance of innovative technologies, such as chatbots, by university students. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate student acceptance and use of chatbots by university students using UTAUT2. Moreover, the present study will serve as the foundation for the design of features aimed at promoting chatbot acceptance and the enhancement of student engagement and performance.},

abstract = {AI-powered chatbots are an emerging technology being adopted by higher education institutions to help manage workload and improve the student experience through providing students information when they want it without searching. However, unlike other technology adoptions that have a “set up and go” infrastructure, the AI backbone of the chatbots is built on intentions and demands cultivated by the entire campus. To explore how institutions were adopting and using chatbots, I conducted a qualitative case study at three public higher education institutions interviewing people within the strategic enrollment management office This study sought to understand three primary things through the Bolman and Deal framework: first, factors influencing adoption and other levels of intentionality embedded in choosing a chatbot. Second, how stakeholders were engaged in the adoption and use of a chatbot, their perceptions of the technology how relationships and perceptions changed in the adoption of the chatbot. And, finally, understanding any institutional processes that may have changed, how those changes were perceived, and what was learned. Pubic higher education institutions (HEIs) are facing increasing competitive pressures and student expectations, resulting in the challenge to create more extensive student support to improve the student experience—all in the midst of diminishing budgets and heightened criticism. Without addressing this capacity issue through improved scaling of services, HEIs will not be able to meet retention, completion, and diversity goals being used to allocate state funding. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore how public higher education student services departments, specifically the Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) offices, adopt and use AI-powered chatbots for improved student services to address increased competitive issues and higher student expectations. I interviewed individuals to understand better the factors that influenced chatbot adoption decisions, the extent and type of engagement by stakeholders across the institution, and what type of institutional change resulted from the chatbot adoption and use. This case study revealed four key elements. The first element was the importance of integration with the institution's technology infrastructure and enterprise-wide processes and policies. Second, having ownership at an executive level created ease of use across multiple divisions/departments. Third, establishing and using metrics can influence the use and scaling of the chatbots' capabilities. And, finally, stakeholder understanding of chatbot capacity is extremely important to the successful adoption of a chatbot to support students.},

A QA system receives an input in the form of sentences and produces the predictive sentences that are responses to the input. Therefore, a model that can learn such conversations is needed. This research focuses on developing a chatbot based on a sequence-to-sequence model. It is trained using a data set of conversation from a university admission. Evaluation on a small dataset obtained from the Telkom University admission on Whatsapp instant messaging application shows that the model produces a quite high BLEU score of 41.04. An attention mechanism technique using the reversed sentences improves the model to gives a higher BLEU up to 44.68.},

This marks the beginning of a frustrating and stressful period for the students as well as the admission staff. Students have countless queries and issues that need to be repeatedly answered and solved by the admission staff. However, with the rise of modern technologies such as conversational agents, the admission process can be automated to decrease the load of the admission staff. Therefore, we investigated the usefulness of a chatbot for university admission that is designed for a specific target demographic. A chatbot was developed named “Jooka” for a university to improve their admission process. Since our target audience is predominately bilingual, we added bilingualism support to Jooka. Jooka understands queries written in English and Arabic, and responds according to the query language. A survey was conducted to evaluate the performance of Jooka with parents and high school participants. Overall, the results showed great acceptance and willingness from users to adopt the new technology.},

The chatbot performs a trade conversation with a customer through an in-built natural language processing unit. In a conversation, it tries to figure out desirable product preferences of customers and it analyzes words, phrases and sentence constructions of customers to automatically indicate their personality in order to correctly react to their predicted personality needs. This paper, based on a recognized personality, describes how the chatbot can adjust its model of actions in the following fields: the display of product presentation and the choice of phrases used in conversations.},

We propose an unsupervised, apriori like algorithm that extracts the subtasks and their valid orderings from un-annotated humanhuman conversations. Modeling dialogues as a combination of sub-tasks and their valid orderings easily captures the variability in conversations. It also provides us the ability to map our dialogue model to AIML constructs and therefore use off-the-shelf AIML interpreters to build task-oriented chatbots. We conduct experiments on real world data sets to establish the effectiveness of the sub-task extraction process.We codify the extracted sub-tasks in an AIML knowledge base and build a chatbot using this knowledge base.

However, the support of these units is limited by office hours, speed and advisory efficiency, and besides, handling and answering questions process may also encounter obstacles such as: overload, misinformation, problem with the transmission, language barriers, expressions, limited time, support resources,{\ldots}Thus we decided to do research to understand this situation. Then creating a dataset supports vocational guidance and advising education enrollment activities. We also design and integrate chatbot into the school system to support the admissions counseling process.},

abstract = {While climate experts have agreed that global warming is real, this consensus has not reached all the society levels. Our aim is to develop a conversational agent able to explain issues related to global warming. The developed chatbot relies on textual entailment to identify the best answer for a statement conveyed by a human agent. To enhance the conversational capabilities we employed the technical instrumentation provided by the API.AI framework. To exploit domain knowledge, the agent uses climate change ontologies converted into a adequate format for the API.AI model. Hence, we developed a Climebot, that is an argumentative agent for climate change based on ontologies and textual entailment.},
