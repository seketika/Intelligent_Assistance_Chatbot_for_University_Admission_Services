abstract = {AI-powered chatbots are an emerging technology being adopted by higher education institutions to help manage workload and improve the student experience through providing students information when they want it without searching. However, unlike other technology adoptions that have a “set up and go” infrastructure, the AI backbone of the chatbots is built on intentions and demands cultivated by the entire campus. To explore how institutions were adopting and using chatbots, I conducted a qualitative case study at three public higher education institutions interviewing people within the strategic enrollment management office This study sought to understand three primary things through the Bolman and Deal framework: first, factors influencing adoption and other levels of intentionality embedded in choosing a chatbot. Second, how stakeholders were engaged in the adoption and use of a chatbot, their perceptions of the technology how relationships and perceptions changed in the adoption of the chatbot. And, finally, understanding any institutional processes that may have changed, how those changes were perceived, and what was learned. Pubic higher education institutions (HEIs) are facing increasing competitive pressures and student expectations, resulting in the challenge to create more extensive student support to improve the student experience—all in the midst of diminishing budgets and heightened criticism. Without addressing this capacity issue through improved scaling of services, HEIs will not be able to meet retention, completion, and diversity goals being used to allocate state funding. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore how public higher education student services departments, specifically the Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) offices, adopt and use AI-powered chatbots for improved student services to address increased competitive issues and higher student expectations. I interviewed individuals to understand better the factors that influenced chatbot adoption decisions, the extent and type of engagement by stakeholders across the institution, and what type of institutional change resulted from the chatbot adoption and use. This case study revealed four key elements. The first element was the importance of integration with the institution's technology infrastructure and enterprise-wide processes and policies. Second, having ownership at an executive level created ease of use across multiple divisions/departments. Third, establishing and using metrics can influence the use and scaling of the chatbots' capabilities. And, finally, stakeholder understanding of chatbot capacity is extremely important to the successful adoption of a chatbot to support students.},

It can be used as a customer service that can provide a response to the customer quickly. A QA system receives an input in the form of sentences and produces the predictive sentences that are responses to the input. Therefore, a model that can learn such conversations is needed. This research focuses on developing a chatbot based on a sequence-to-sequence model. It is trained using a data set of conversation from a university admission. Evaluation on a small dataset obtained from the Telkom University admission on Whatsapp instant messaging application shows that the model produces a quite high BLEU score of 41.04. An attention mechanism technique using the reversed sentences improves the model to gives a higher BLEU up to 44.68.},

abstract = {The advancements in computer systems and networks have created a new environment for criminal acts, widely known as cybercrime. Cybercrime incidents are occurrences of particular criminal offences that pose a serious threat to the global economy, safety, and well-being of society. This paper offers a comprehensive understanding of cybercrime incidents and their corresponding offences combining a series of approaches reported in relevant literature. Initially, this paper reviews and identifies the features of cybercrime incidents, their respective elements and proposes a combinatorial incident description schema. The schema provides the opportunity to systematically combine various elements - or cybercrime characteristics. Additionally, a comprehensive list of cybercrime-related offences is put forward. The offences are ordered in a two-level classification system based on specific criteria to assist in better classification and correlation of their respective incidents. This enables a thorough understanding of the repeating and underlying criminal activities. The proposed system can serve as a common reference overtaking obstacles deriving from misconceptions for cybercrimes with cross-border activities. The proposed schema can be extended with a list of recommended actions, corresponding measures and effective policies that match with the offence type and subsequently with a particular incident. This matching will enable better monitoring, handling and moderate cybercrime incident occurrences. The ultimate objective is to incorporate the schema-based description of cybercrime elements to a complete incident management system with standard operating procedures and protocols.},

To scale for-credit options, workflows and policies must be devised to preserve the characteristics of accredited higher education-such as the presumption of human evaluation and an assertion of academic integrity-despite increased scale. These efforts must follow as well with shifting from offering isolated courses (or informal collections thereof) to offering full degree programs with additional administrative elements. We see this shift as one from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to Large, Internet-Mediated Asynchronous Degrees (Limeades). In this work, we perform a qualitative research study on one such program that has scaled to 6,500 students while retaining full accreditation.

Recent work on building task-oriented dialog systems have emphasized the need for acquiring taskspecific knowledge from un-annotated conversational data. In our work we acquire task-specific knowledge by defining subtask as the key unit of a task-oriented conversation. We propose an unsupervised, apriori like algorithm that extracts the subtasks and their valid orderings from un-annotated humanhuman conversations. Modeling dialogues as a combination of sub-tasks and their valid orderings easily captures the variability in conversations. It also provides us the ability to map our dialogue model to AIML constructs and therefore use off-the-shelf AIML interpreters to build task-oriented chatbots. We conduct experiments on real world data sets to establish the effectiveness of the sub-task extraction process.We codify the extracted sub-tasks in an AIML knowledge base and build a chatbot using this knowledge base. We also show the usefulness of the chatbot in automatically handling customer requests by performing a user evaluation study. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents an empirical investigation on what behavioral information security governance factors drives the establishment of information security knowledge sharing in organizations. Data was collected from organizations located in different geographic regions of the world, and the amount of data collected from two countries - namely, USA and Sweden - allowed us to investigate if the effect of behavioral information security governance factors on the establishment of security knowledge sharing differs based on national culture. The study followed a mixed methods research design, wherein qualitative data was collected to both establish the study's research model and develop a survey instrument that was distributed to 578 information security executives. The results suggest that processes to coordinate implemented security knowledge sharing mechanisms have a major direct influence on the establishment of security knowledge sharing in organizations; the effect of organizational structure (e.g., centralized security function to develop and deploy uniform firm-wide policies, and use of steering committees to facilitate information security planning) is slightly weaker, while business-based information security management has no significant direct effect on security knowledge sharing. A mediation analysis revealed that the reason for the nonsignificant direct relation between business-based information security management and security knowledge sharing is the fully mediating effect of coordinating information security processes. Thus, the results disentangles the interrelated influences of behavioral information security governance factors on security knowledge sharing by showing that information security governance sets the platform to establish security knowledge sharing, and coordinating processes realize the effect of both the structure of the information security function and the alignment of information security management with business needs. A multigroup analysis identified that national culture had a significant moderating effect on the association between four of the six proposed relations. In Sweden - which is seen as a less individualist, feminine country - managers tend to focus their efforts on implementing controls that are aligned with business activities and employees' need; monitoring the effectiveness of the implemented controls, and assuring that the controls are not too obtrusive to the end-user. On the contrary, US organizations establish security knowledge sharing in their organization through formal arrangements and structures. These results imply that Swedish managers perceive it to be important to involve, or at least know how their employees cope with the decisions that have been made, thus favoring local participation in information security management, while US managers may feel the need to have more central control when running their information security function. The findings suggest that national culture should be taken into consideration in future studies - in particular when investigating organizations operating in a global environment - and understand how it affects behaviors and decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Purpose: This paper critically analyses the human factors or behaviours as major threats to cyber security. Focus is placed on the usual roles played by both the attackers and defenders (the targets of the attacker) in cyber threats' pervasiveness and the potential impacts of such actions on critical security infrastructures. Design/Methodology/Approach: To enable an effective and practical analysis, the Anonymous attack against HBGary Federal (A security firm in the United State of America) was taken as a case study to reveal the huge damaging impacts of human errors and attitudes against the security of organizations and individuals. Findings: The findings revealed that the powerful security firm was compromised and overtaken through simple SQL injection techniques and a very crafty social engineering attack which succeeded because of sheer personnel negligence and unwitting utterances. The damage caused by the attack was enormous and it includes the exposure of very sensitive and personal data, complete shutdown of the website, loss of backup data and personnel character deformations. The research also found that damaging human factors results from ignorance or illiteracy to basic security practices, carelessness and sometimes sabotage by disgruntled employees from within and these vulnerabilities have become prime target for exploitation by attackers through social engineering attacks. Social engineering was also discovered to be the leading attack technique adopted by attackers within the cyber space in recent years. Practical Implications: The paper concludes by advocating assiduous training and cyber security awareness programmes for workforces and the implementations and maintenance of basic security culture and policies as a panacea for social engineering cyber attacks against individuals and organizations. Originality: Lots of work has been done and many still ongoing in the field of social engineering attacks and human factors, but this study is the first to adopt an approach of a practical case study to critically analyze the effects of human factors on cyber security.},

abstract = {The present paper focuses on Cyber Security Awareness Campaigns, and aims to identify key factors regarding security which may lead them to failing to appropriately change people's behaviour. Past and current efforts to improve information-security practices and promote a sustainable society have not had the desired impact. It is important therefore to critically reflect on the challenges involved in improving information-security behaviours for citizens, consumers and employees. In particular, our work considers these challenges from a Psychology perspective, as we believe that understanding how people perceive risks is critical to creating effective awareness campaigns. Changing behaviour requires more than providing information about risks and reactive behaviours - firstly, people must be able to understand and apply the advice, and secondly, they must be motivated and willing to do so - and the latter requires changes to attitudes and intentions. These antecedents of behaviour change are identified in several psychological models of behaviour. We review the suitability of persuasion techniques, including the widely used 'fear appeals'. From this range of literature, we extract essential components for an awareness campaign as well as factors which can lead to a campaign's success or failure. Finally, we present examples of existing awareness campaigns in different cultures (the UK and Africa) and reflect on these.},

While organizations expand their use of advanced security technology and continuously train their security professionals, very little is used to increase the security awareness among the normal users, making them the weakest link in any organization. As a result, today, organized cyber criminals are putting significant efforts to research and develop advanced hacking methods that can be used to steal money and iriformation from the general public. Furthermore, the high internet penetration growth rate in the Middle East and the limited security awareness among users is making it an attractive target for cyber criminals. In this paper, we will show the need for security education, training, and awareness programs in schools, universities, governments, and private organizations in the Middle East by presenting results of several security awareness studies conducted among students and professionals in UAE in 2010. This includes a comprehensive wireless security survey in which thousands of access points were detected in Dubai and Sharjah most of which are either unprotected or employ weak types of protection. Another study focuses on studying the chances of general users to fall victims to phishing attacks which can be used to steal bank and personal information.},

abstract = {Children under 11 are often regarded as too young to comprehend the implications of online privacy. Perhaps as a result, little research has focused on younger kids' risk recognition and coping. Such knowledge is, however, critical for designing efficient safeguarding mechanisms for this age group. Through 12 focus group studies with 29 children aged 6-10 from UK schools, we examined how children described privacy risks related to their use of tablet computers and what information was used by them to identify threats. We found that children could identify and articulate certain privacy risks well, such as information oversharing or revealing real identities online; however, they had less awareness with respect to other risks, such as online tracking or game promotions. Our findings offer promising directions for supporting children's awareness of cyber risks and the ability to protect themselves online.},

In higher education services including admission services, a university needs to always provide excellent service to ensure student candidate satisfaction. To obtain student candidate satisfaction apart from the quality of education must also be accompanied by providing consultation services and information to them. This paper proposes the development of Chatbot which acts as a conversation agent that can play a role of as student candidate service. This Chatbot is called Dinus Intelligent Assistance (DINA). DINA uses knowledge based as a center for machine learning approach. The pattern extracted from the knowledge based can be used to provide responses to the user. The source of knowledge based is taken from Universitas Dian Nuswantoro (UDINUS) guest book. It contains of questions and answers about UDINUS admission services. Testing of this system is done by entering questions. From 166 intents, the author tested it using ten random sample questions. Among them, it got eight tested questions answered correctly. Therefore, by using this study we can develop further intelligent Chatbots to help student candidates find the information they need without waiting for the admission staffs's answer.},

abstract = {Most efforts to improve cyber security focus primarily on incorporating new technological approaches in products and processes. However, a key element of improvement involves acknowledging the importance of human behavior when designing, building and using cyber security technology. In this survey paper, we describe why incorporating an understanding of human behavior into cyber security products and processes can lead to more effective technology. We present two examples: the first demonstrates how leveraging behavioral science leads to clear improvements, and the other illustrates how behavioral science offers the potential for significant increases in the effectiveness of cyber security. Based on feedback collected from practitioners in preliminary interviews, we narrow our focus to two important behavioral aspects: cognitive load and bias. Next, we identify proven and potential behavioral science findings that have cyber security relevance, not only related to cognitive load and bias but also to heuristics and behavioral science models. We conclude by suggesting several next steps for incorporating behavioral science findings in our technological design, development and use. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For this study, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) is adopted for this educational context. A quantitative survey-based approach was used to collect data from 431 undergraduate and computer science masters students at Brunel University London. The data were analysed using partial least squares - structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS3. The findings showed that three primary constructs, namely, performance expectancy, effort expectancy and habit significantly predicted students' behavioural intention (BI) to use chatbot technology. Our results can guide policymakers in their attempts to explain and encourage the adoption and acceptance of innovative technologies, such as chatbots, by university students. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate student acceptance and use of chatbots by university students using UTAUT2. Moreover, the present study will serve as the foundation for the design of features aimed at promoting chatbot acceptance and the enhancement of student engagement and performance.},

This study focuses on the evaluation of parents' beliefs and knowledge about their 6 to 9-year-old children's Internet use. The sample is composed of 1827 parents who received a specially designed questionnaire. Results of the descriptive analysis show that 78{\%} of children of these ages use the Internet, mainly for homework and games. Most of the parents are aware of the benefits and risks of the Internet, but roughly half of them state that they do not know how to set up content filters or parental controls, which is rather relevant, taking into account that 40{\%} of these young children are sometimes left alone when online. At this age, some children have already had a bad experience when using the Internet.

The goal of this paper is to present successful implementation of the recognition of customer personalities, which has an impact on improving human–computer interactions. For that purpose, a sample Internet shop was created with a chatbot playing the role of a shop-assistant that is similar to a real shop-assistant in a traditional shop. The chatbot performs a trade conversation with a customer through an in-built natural language processing unit. In a conversation, it tries to figure out desirable product preferences of customers and it analyzes words, phrases and sentence constructions of customers to automatically indicate their personality in order to correctly react to their predicted personality needs. This paper, based on a recognized personality, describes how the chatbot can adjust its model of actions in the following fields: the display of product presentation and the choice of phrases used in conversations.},

However, with the rise of modern technologies such as conversational agents, the admission process can be automated to decrease the load of the admission staff. Therefore, we investigated the usefulness of a chatbot for university admission that is designed for a specific target demographic. A chatbot was developed named “Jooka” for a university to improve their admission process. Since our target audience is predominately bilingual, we added bilingualism support to Jooka. Jooka understands queries written in English and Arabic, and responds according to the query language. A survey was conducted to evaluate the performance of Jooka with parents and high school participants.

Personality constructs have recently been found to explain even more variance in behavior, thus providing insights into user behavior.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are one of top investment priorities in these days. They are aimed at finding applications in fields of special value for humans, including education. Chatbots are one of those AI-driven solutions that support learning and teaching processes also in higher education institutions. In this paper there are presented two cases of chatbot technology implementation at Polish universities. Chatbots develop students' technical and programming skills, but also provide the possibility of gaining linguistic expertise. However, a chatbot's teaching mastery depends also on its users. That is why it is important to get students to truly understand AI systems and feel responsible for the conversation. But above all, we should ensure that chatbots respect human and civil rights.

This process is very tedious and time consuming, also it requires manpower in providing required information to visitors. Hence, to overcome the problems a chatbot can be developed. The project is about interaction between users and chatbot which can be accessed from anywhere anytime. The chatbot can be easily attached with any university or college website with few simple language conversions. Chatbot provides various information related to university or college and also students-related information. The chatbot can be used by anyone who can access the university's website. The project uses the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. PHP Language is utilized for the development of Chatbot. User can ask university-related questions, then the query is applied as an input to algorithm, which processes the message and displays the corresponding response to the user. The Project GUI is similar to a Messaging Application.},

abstract = {:Cyber security is the activity of protecting information and information systems (networks, computers, data bases, data centres and applications) with appropriate procedural and technological security measures. Firewalls, antivirus software, and other technological solutions for safeguarding personal data and computer networks are essential but not sufficient to ensure security. As our nation rapidly building its CyberInfrastructure, it is equally important that we educate our population to work properly with this infrastructure. Cyber-Ethics, Cyber-Safety, and Cyber-Security issues need to be integrated in the educational process beginning at an early age. Security counter measures help ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information systems by preventing or mitigating asset losses from Cyber security attacks. Recently cyber security has emerged as an established discipline for computer systems andinfrastructures with a focus on protection of valuable information stored on those systems fromadversaries who want to obtain, corrupt, damage, destroy or prohibit access to it. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a program that analyses what happens or has happened during an execution and tries to find indications that the computer has been misused. A wide range of metaphors was considered, including those relating to: military and other types of conflict, biological, health care, markets, three-dimensional space, and physical asset protection. These in turn led to consideration of a variety of possible approaches for improving cyber security in the future. These approaches were labelled “Heterogeneity” ,“Motivating Secure Behaviour” and “Cyber Wellness” . Cyber Security plays an important role in the development of information technology as well as Internet services. Our attention is usually drawn on “Cyber Security” when we hear about “Cyber Crimes”. Our first thought on “National Cyber Security” therefore starts on how good is our infrastructure for handling “Cyber Crimes”. This paper focus on cyber security emerging trends while adopting new technologies such as mobile computing, cloud computing, e-commerce, and social networking. The paper also describes the challenges due to lack of coordination between Security agencies and the Critical IT Infrastructure},

Nowadays children are using the internet on a daily basis for many reasons; playing online games, social media or even for doing their school works. The internet takes a huge part of their times and unfortunately, most of these children are not aware of online risks and how they should respond properly to online risks. Moreover, children may have unlimited access to the internet without any control or supervision. The cybercrimes are increasing year after a year and the government of UAE considers the safety of the citizens as one of the most priorities to achieve. As the safety of our children is a priority, the Ministry of Education in UAE provided a cyber security awareness program for children in order to raise their security awareness level about online risks and online best practices. The objective of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of the cyber security awareness program offered by the Ministry of Education in UAE to students aged 8 to 10 years old. This research paper methodology based on qualitative methods for collecting data in which data were collected from interviews conducted with both the trainers of the program and students who attended the program. It was found that the children may expose to different online risks and the topics included in the cyber security awareness program were effective and aligned along with possible online risks children may expose to. Both the trainers and the students agreed on the efficiency of the cyber security awareness program and students believed that the awareness program influenced their online behavior. Although the interviews provided valuable findings, the real effectiveness of the cyber security awareness program hard to be measured as it depends on how students will behave online.},

To review the highest level of available evidence, a systematic mapping review was conducted to identify systematic reviews that investigated the relationship between cyberbullying and mental and psychological outcomes in young people. Topic-relevant bibliographic databases and online resources were searched to identify reviews published since 2007. Data were extracted using a coding tool developed for this study. Methodological quality of included reviews was assessed using AMSTAR criteria. Nineteen systematic reviews satisfied the inclusion criteria and they reported a strong negative association between cyberbullying and mental health outcomes in young people. Meta-analysis was performed in 11 reviews and narrative synthesis in 8 reviews. Data were derived from predominantly cross-sectional studies and a clear causal relationship between cyberbullying and mental outcomes cannot be established. Two-third of the included reviews were classified to be of low or unclear quality, due to the lack of quality assessment of the primary studies included in individual reviews. This systematic map consolidates available evidence at review level and confirms the existing gaps in longitudinal and qualitative evidence synthesis. Closer examination of the moderating factors influencing cyberbullying behaviors in future research can advance our understanding and inform the development of tailored programs of intervention to mitigate the negative impact of this phenomenon.},

The author points out that whereas the benefits of online children literature are immense especially in Africa where there is paucity of print literature, increasing cyber security and crime targeting children is of growing concern to governments, school teachers, parents, and Internet service providers. The chapter observes that whereas the developed world has made attempts to put in place mechanisms and systems such as acceptable user policies and protection software to mitigate undesirable consequences of online insecurity to which children are the most vulnerable, Africa is lagging behind despite the pervading Internet on the continent. The author notes that censorship of online literature is not the panacea to cyber insecurity, but parents should work closely with teachers and service providers to find pragmatic ways of protecting children online. Africa could learn a lot from developed countries on how to balance between access to useful online information resources against the growing cyber crime targeting children. The author cautions that the future of online security with regard to children's safety in cyberspace is bound to become more complex as technologies become more advanced and online predators evolve sophisticated ways to circumvent online security measures, calling for the development of a proactive security strategy to protect children online. {\textcopyright} 2008, IGI Global.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity for children has received much attention and has become a rapidly growing topic due to the increased availability of the internet to children and their consequent exposure to various online risks. This paper aims to summarize the current findings on cybersecurity awareness research for children and help guide future studies. We have performed a systematic literature review on cybersecurity awareness for children, analyzing 56 peer-reviewed studies that report in depth on various cybersecurity risks and awareness-raising approaches. The results of this review include a list of cybersecurity risks for children, a list of commonly used approaches and theories for raising cybersecurity awareness among children, and a list of factors that researchers have considered when evaluating cybersecurity awareness approaches and solutions.},

abstract = {In this paper, we review the pervasiveness of cyber threats and the roles of both attackers and defenders (i.e. the targets of the attackers): The lack of awareness of eyber-threats by users; the complexity of the new cyber environment, including cyber risks: engineering approaches and tools to mitigate cyber threats; and research to identify proactive steps that users and teams can take to reducc cyber-threats. In addition, we review the research needed on the psychology of human users that pose risks to all users from eyber-attacks. For the latter, we review the available theory at the individual and group levels that may help individual users, groups and organizations take actions against cyber threats. We end with future research needs and conclusions.},

abstract = {With the advancement of technology and the development of new tools, games, applications and social media sites, it is getting difficult every day to keep up with threats and vulnerabilities associated with these tools, apps or websites, especially for children. This paper provides an overview of the challenges in cyber security education for children. The goal of this research is to investigate and further develop new knowledge and tools that will be helpful and effective to teach the children about cyber security by performing various gamified actions in a playful, engaging and motivating manner. The methodology of this research would be both qualitative and quantitative, using interviews, questionnaires, focus group and observations. Initially, this project will define the theoretical and existing practices of cyber security awareness education for children. In the next phase, this research will design and implement interventions based on learning activities like workshops and collaborative tasks; followed by empirical test and evaluation of the proposed interventions.},

abstract = {Operating systems and programmes are more protected these days and attackers have shifted their attention to human elements to break into the organisation's information systems. As the number and frequency of cyber-attacks designed to take advantage of unsuspecting personnel are increasing, the significance of the human factor in information security management cannot be understated. In order to counter cyber-attacks designed to exploit human factors in information security chain, information security awareness with an objective to reduce information security risks that occur due to human related vulnerabilities is paramount. This paper discusses and evaluates the effects of various information security awareness delivery methods used in improving end-users information security awareness and behaviour. There are a wide range of information security awareness delivery methods such as web-based training materials, contextual training and embedded training. In spite of efforts to increase information security awareness, research is scant regarding effective information security awareness delivery methods. To this end, this study focuses on determining the security awareness delivery method that is most successful in providing information security awareness and which delivery method is preferred by users. We conducted information security awareness using text-based, game-based and video-based delivery methods with the aim of determining user preferences. Our study suggests that a combined delivery methods are better than individual security awareness delivery method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},
